Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Only VGG and Alexnet classified the correct breed for Dog_01, Resnet classified the dog
        as a different breed. The Siberian husky and the Alaskan malamute are both Arctic
        dogs but each come from different locations.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the breeds classified for Dog_02 were different than the classfied breeds for Dog_01.
        Model VGG : Dog_01 (malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute), Dog_02 (eskimo dog, husky)
        Model Alexnet : Dog_01 (malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute), Dog_02 (pug, pug-dog)
        Model Resnet : Dog_01 (eskimo dog, husky ), Dog_02 (norwegian elkhound, elkhound)


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures correctly classified the object Starship_01 the same, and 
        models VGG & Alexnet were the only architectures to classify the animal GIANT_TARANTULA_01
        correctly. The model Resnet classified the animal under the wrong breed.

        Model VGG : GIANT_TARANTULA_01 (wolf spider, hunting spider)
        Model Alexnet : GIANT_TARANTULA_01 (wolf spider, hunting spider )
        Model Resnet : GIANT_TARANTULA_01(frilled lizard, chlamydosaurus kingi )

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The most accurate model architecture was VGG because it classified all four images to 
        a relevant description, while the other two models classified Dog_02 to a different 
        breed.
